INSTALLATION

1. Download the g-zipped tar archive  popgen_*.*-*.tar.gz

2.  Install the package using     

	R CMD INSTALL -l /path/to/LIB popgen_*.*-*.tar.gz

/path/to/LIB should be the library directory where you wish to put the package.

If you have root access to your machine then use 

	R CMD INSTALL popgen_*.*-*.tar.gz

and the package will be put into the default R library tree.

5. You can then start an R session and load the package using

	library(popgen, lib.loc="/path/to/LIB")

or 

 library(popgen) 

(if you installed the package into the default R library tree)
